# Coder reactjs project

This project was made to practice React Js and develop an ecommerce following Coder's guidelines. 

## Used libraries 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For the routing I used:

    "react-router-dom" version "^6.0.1"

Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap:

    "react-bootstrap" version "^2.0.0-rc.1"
    "bootstrap" version "^5.1.1"
    "bootstrap-icons" version "^1.6.1"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
